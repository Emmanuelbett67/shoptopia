# vue-project - Shopping List App

This was built after completing [Vue.js 3 Fundamentals with Composition API course](https://vueschool.io/courses/vue-js-fundamentals-with-the-composition-api).

I had to gracefully find a way to build the course project out using Single File Component and Props. Yeah! that's the fun!

Vue.js has an [amazingly sweet documentation](https://vuejs.org/).

Shout out ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ to my amazing teacher, [Sir Daniel Kelly](https://twitter.com/danielkelly_io)!
